A proof of concept, unfinished, with some butt ugly textures, modlet that demonstrates how to implement melee weapon modifiers.  Hopefully some Blender guy will want to make some better attachments for this mod and collaborate to make it a more finished modlet.  Currently there is no localization, only a placeholder file for recipes, and the benefits of each weapon attachment is basic and unbalanced.  Like I said, its a proof of concept/teaching modlet that hopes to be a work in progress.
